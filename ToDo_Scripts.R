##### BOTH ####
1) Add slow bottleneck to the infile generator

##### ALEX ####
2)  Sampling:
  a.	One sample group per record
    i.	Two scripts 
      1.	One for bins
      2.	One for every record

##### DITTE ####
3)	Effective pop size
  a.	We will use the census estimates on IUCN
  b.	When not available it would be substituted by literature

##### DITTE ####
4)	Mutation rates
  a.	Uniform prior from 1% to 10 %, following Chan (2006 methods)
  b.	Check if there is a difference between cyt-b and D-loop\Control reg

##### DONE ####
5)	Number of populations
  a.	For now, one population 2 statistical groups (e.i. before and after)

##### ALEX ####
6)  Mutation model
    Find the way to define the substitution models in the infiles
      Check the Jmodeltest outfiles for the species and create a list with the models for each species

##### ALEX ####
7) Make the cluster work... easy peasy!
